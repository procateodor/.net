## Building a RESTful API with Express and MongoDB

This project is the product of a tutorial I wrote with the same title, you can [read it here](https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/building-a-restful-api-with-express-and-mongodb--3mmh). The API interacts with a mongoDB through get, post, put, patch and delete. 

### Instructions

Install requered packages

    npm install 

Change the database adress in `.env`

Run server 

    npm start 

Visit `http://localhost:5656/api/books/` for the API root.
